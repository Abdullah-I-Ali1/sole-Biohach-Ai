## Overview

This project aims to analyze the genomic signatures of SARS-CoV-2 using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in an alignment-free approach.

## Problem Statement

Traditional alignment-based phylogenetic methods require significant computational resources. This project provides an efficient alternative by extracting genomic signatures and applying ML and DL models to classify SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

## Steps Taken 

> Data Processing

## AI Model Submission


This repository contains workflow that demonstrates the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models for classification. The dataset used in this project is train.csv, which contains labeled data for training and testing purposes.


## Data Preprocessing:

> Missing value handling
> Feature scaling using StandardScaler
> Label encoding of categorical values
> Oversampling using SMOTE to handle class imbalance
> Model Training & Evaluation:

## Models used:


 Random Forest
 XGBoost
 LightGBM
 Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)

## Aim:

Analyzed results to identify SARS-CoV-2 lineages with high precision.

Implementation
The entire workflow was implemented using 100% Python, utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, and NumPy.
